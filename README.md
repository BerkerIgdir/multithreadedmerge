# Multithreaded Merge Sort
A multithreaded approach to merge sort algorithm

With it's current implementation, the algorithim suffers from excessive space complexity. In order to reduce the complexity, new classes will be added for each primitive type in Java. 

It is suggested to enable the parallel garbage collector when using the algorithm as it demonstrates better throughput.
